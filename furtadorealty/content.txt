Client Reviews...
"We had a unique situation, it took us almost 12 months to close the deal. We would not be able to do it without Joey Furtado! We had a different realtor prior to Joey, and she WAS NOT able (or did not want) to deal with our situation . Joey is not just a realtor, he will take care of you as if he was your family member! Call Joey Furtado today if you need to sell or buy a house today! Thank you, Joey! You are the best!"

"Joey Furtado and the team at Select Group Realty did a fantastic job with helping us purchase our property. They worked closely with our lenders and were extremely accommodating when they had to repeatedly open the doors for contractors during our due diligence period, including recommending experts to assist in the due diligence. We would love the opportunity to work with them again."

"I loved working with Joey. I called him on short notice, he set up a showing within 24 hours of the property hitting the market. We sent in an offer and got it accepted the next day. They say this is a seller's market, but if you have the right team, you can get the property you want. I'm impressed with Joey, oh yeah he was able to get the sellers to put a new roof on the home, in a seller's market. Joey and the team are masters at negotiation."

"Joey has been my agent since buying my first home 3 years ago. Throughout the whole process, Joey was always readily available and very prompt and helped ensure everything was done quickly and efficiently. One time I had an issue with something on the property so I texted Joey and he was at the house within an hour and didn’t leave until the issue was resolved. I wouldn’t work with anyone else. He has a great knowledge of the industry and the local market. Working with Joey, I always feel like he has my best interest in mind and genuinely acts on my behalf. I couldn't imagine going through anyone else then or in the future. He has my highest recommendation."
   - Gabe H.
"Joey helped me buy a house after only a couple of months of looking. He was willing to work around my schedule to do the viewings, was very responsive, and knew what he was doing. He went above and beyond, writing a letter to go along with my offer that would help the seller choose me. He not only helped me close the deal without hiccups and in record time, but he kept in touch afterward and made sure all my new homeowner worries and needs were taken care of. It's rare to find a realtor that will go to such great lengths to make you happy."
   - Shelley
"Joey is very easy to get along with and would always make extra efforts to explain the details of a home, and the options/alternatives available within the market. As our buyers agent, he's made it so simple for us to navigate properties that meet our requests and there's never been a time where we've felt that he's not looking out for our best interests. I recommend Joey for any of your real estate needs, he's dedicated, professional, and fun to work with."
   - Damon S.
"I met Joey as a For Sale By Owner! I had been trying to sell my duplex for months, and only getting offers below what I had paid for it 9 years prior, before any of the upgrades. Joey made the selling experience fun with his great sense of humor, and really set me at ease with his professional knowledge. He found a buyer right away! We closed fast and I finally got what I wanted out of my investment! You're awesome Joey!"
   - Shannon R.
"Joey put his personal life on hold to make sure we found a house within our price range that we liked. He's a stand up guy--honest, hard working, and gun to be around. It was such a fun experience house shopping with him."
   - Jeanette M.
"Joey is my guy for any of my future purchases. He knows this market works his tail off for you. I will continue to send my friends your way! Thanks again for all your hard work."
   - Scott C.
