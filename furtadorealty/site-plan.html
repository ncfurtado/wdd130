        Style Guide
      </h2>
<!-- PARC: Proximity - Headings should be added their corresponding paragraphs, as it makes sense
Alignment - the left edge of things should be aligned, rather than centering everything else
Repetition - keep a similar theme of fonts, styles, and elements to go with the mold and make it easy to consume
Contrast - keep your text color able to be seen well, but also contrasting heading and paragraph fonts too -->

        What do Clients say about Joey?
        
        I bought my first home about a year ago.  Being a first time home buyer, the entire process was completely foreign to me.  Going into it, I was pretty apprehensive and uncertain about what to expect.  The list of questions was a bit overwhelming.  I met Joey Furtado early on in the process and I was immediately impressed by his knowledge and experience.  He seemed to know things about every aspect of the process and made me feel comfortable and reassured in deciding to buy.  Joey was always available and extremely helpful.  He made sure everything with the home purchase went forward smoothly and without delay.   He advocated on my behalf by negotiating everything from reducing the purchase price to getting a brand new A/C unit and water heater.  I have every intention of enlisting his services whenever the next purchase may come.  He is an exceptional agent! 
        Give him a call today to see how he can help you! -Gabe Herr, Salt Lake City. Utah

      <p>"We had a unique situation, it took us almost 12 months to close the deal. We would not be able to do it without Joey Furtado! We had a different realtor prior to Joey, and she WAS NOT able (or did not want) to deal with our situation . Joey is not just a realtor, he will take care of you as if he was your family member! Call Joey Furtado today if you need to sell or buy a house today! Thank you, Joey! You are the best!"
        - G. Sveshnikova</p>
      <p>"Joey Furtado and the team at Select Group Realty did a fantastic job with helping us purchase our property. They worked closely with our lenders and were extremely accommodating when they had to repeatedly open the doors for contractors during our due diligence period, including recommending experts to assist in the due diligence. We would love the opportunity to work with them again."
        - Chiao-ih H.</p>
      <p>"I loved working with Joey. I called him on short notice, he set up a showing within 24 hours of the property hitting the market. We sent in an offer and got it accepted the next day. They say this is a seller's market, but if you have the right team, you can get the property you want. I'm impressed with Joey, oh yeah he was able to get the sellers to put a new roof on the home, in a seller's market. Joey and the team are masters at negotiation."
          - Carter C.</p>
      <p>"Joey has been my agent since buying my first home 3 years ago. Throughout the whole process, Joey was always readily available and very prompt and helped ensure everything was done quickly and efficiently. One time I had an issue with something on the property so I texted Joey and he was at the house within an hour and didn’t leave until the issue was resolved. I wouldn’t work with anyone else. He has a great knowledge of the industry and the local market. Working with Joey, I always feel like he has my best interest in mind and genuinely acts on my behalf. I couldn't imagine going through anyone else then or in the future. He has my highest recommendation."
        - Gabe H.</p>
      <p>"Joey helped me buy a house after only a couple of months of looking. He was willing to work around my schedule to do the viewings, was very responsive, and knew what he was doing. He went above and beyond, writing a letter to go along with my offer that would help the seller choose me. He not only helped me close the deal without hiccups and in record time, but he kept in touch afterward and made sure all my new homeowner worries and needs were taken care of. It's rare to find a realtor that will go to such great lengths to make you happy."
        - Shelley</p>
      <p>"Joey is very easy to get along with and would always make extra efforts to explain the details of a home, and the options/alternatives available within the market. As our buyers agent, he's made it so simple for us to navigate properties that meet our requests and there's never been a time where we've felt that he's not looking out for our best interests. I recommend Joey for any of your real estate needs, he's dedicated, professional, and fun to work with."
